# Welcome contributors to the project: 

State what to expect for guidelines, ie ; 

Short links to important resources:
  - docs: handbook / roadmap (you'll learn more about this in the roadmapping session)
  - bugs: issue tracker / bug report tool
  - comms: forum link, developer list, IRC/email



# Environment details: 

How to set up your development environment. This might exist in the README.md depending on the project. If so, include a link. 

# How to submit changes: 

Pull Request protocol etc. You might also include what response they'll get back from the team on submission, or any caveats about the speed of response. 

# How to report a bug: 

Bugs are problems in code, in the functionality of an application or in its UI design; you can submit them through "bug trackers" and most projects invite you to do so, so that they may "debug" with more efficiency and the input of a contributor. Take a look at Atom's example for how to teach people to report bugs to your project. 


# Templates: 

In this section of your file, you might also want to link to a bug report "template" like this one here which contributors can copy and add context to; this will keep your bugs tidy and relevant. 

# First bugs for Contributors: 

Sometimes it is helpful to provide some guidelines for the types of bugs contributors should tackle (should they want to fix the bugs and not just submit them), see Atom's example section here. 

# How to request an "enhancement": 

Enhancements are features that you might like to suggest to a project, but aren't necessarily bugs/problems with the existing code; there is a "label" for enhancments in Github's Issues (where you report bugs), so you can tag issues as "enhancement," and thereby allow contributors to prioritize issues/bugs reported to the project. See Atom's example section. 

# Style Guide / Coding conventions: 
 
# Who is involved?:  

Open Government's CONTRIBUTING.md has as a name/author, and it might be nice to have a more personal/friendly individual to attact to a project and reach out to with questions. You might list the core contributors and their preferred methods of contact here, or link to a humans.txt file in your root directory (same place as your CONTRIBUTING.md file), which lets people know who they are working. Here is an example of a humans.txt file.
